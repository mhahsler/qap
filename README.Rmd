```

This package implements heuristics for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) 
first introduced by Koopmans and Beckmann (1957).
Although, the QAP was introduced as a combinatorial optimization problem for the facility location problem in operations research, it also has many applications in data analysis (see Hubert and Schultz; 1976).

The problem is NP-hard and the package implements the simulated annealing heuristic described in [Burkard and Rendl (1984)](#BR1984).

```{r echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
pkg_install(pkg)
```

## Usage

Load the had12 QAPLIB problem (shipped with the package). The problem contains the A and B matrices and the optimal solution. We run 10 repetitions and use the best solution.
```{r}
library(qap)
set.seed(1000)

p <- read_qaplib(system.file("qaplib", "had20.dat", package="qap"))
p$opt

a <- qap(p$A, p$B, rep = 10)
a
```

Compare with known optimum (% above optimum).
```{r}
(attr(a, "obj") - p$opt)/p$opt * 100
```
