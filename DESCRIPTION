Description: Implements heuristics for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Although, the QAP was introduced as a combinatorial optimization problem for the facility location problem in operations research, it also has many applications in data analysis. The problem is NP-hard and the package implements a simulated annealing heuristic.
